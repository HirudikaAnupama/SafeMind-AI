# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for a Custom Chatbot

This project focuses on fine-tuning **GPT-2** to build an AI-powered chatbot trained on a custom dataset of mental health and emotional support conversations. The chatbot is designed to provide meaningful responses to user queries using NLP and deep learning techniques.

## What I Did:
- Collected and preprocessed multiple datasets related to mental health counseling and emotional support.
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset to ensure high-quality text for training.
- Formatted the data into a conversational structure (User Query → AI Response).
- Tokenized the text and fine-tuned **GPT-2** using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API.
- Evaluated the model’s performance and optimized hyperparameters for better response quality.

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- Pandas & NumPy

## Key Learnings:
- Data quality significantly impacts model performance. Proper text preprocessing (removing duplicates, handling contractions, and cleaning special characters) improves response accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning (batch size, learning rate, warmup steps) plays a crucial role in stabilizing training.
- Using **perplexity (PPL) as an evaluation metric** helped measure response coherence.

## Next Steps:
- Implement fine-tuning on **GPT-3.5** for even better results.
- Deploy the chatbot as an API for real-world use.
- Integrate **sentiment analysis** to enhance response personalization.
